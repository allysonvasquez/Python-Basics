# Python Basics
I am using Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) and peer-reviewed academic journal [The Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/) as guides to review and practice basic concepts in python.

## Programming Basics
My goal in this section is to simply refresh my memory on python syntax.

* [Calculator](Python-Basics/1-Programming-Basics/Calculator.py)
  - Review over basic syntax, math operators, and data type casting for variables.
* [String Manipulator](Python-Basics/1-Programming-Basics/StringManipulation.py)
  - Manipulation of strings; uses concatenation, substrings, slicing, and other string operators.
* [Comparison/Boolean Operators](Python-Basics/1-Programming-Basics/Comparison.py)
  - Practice using random operator & boolean/comparison operators with user input
* [Functions](Python-Basics/1-Programming-Basics/FunctionPractice.py)
  - Using lists and functions to solve prompts in [Python functions - Exercises, Practice, Solution](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-functions-exercises.php)
* [Dictionaries](Python-Basics/1-Programming-Basics/Dictionaries.py)
  - Notes on dictionaries that cover its syntax and methods

## Automating Tasks
This section will cover topics that are unfamiliar to me. There will be a mix of in-depth notes and practice projects.
My goal in this section is to fully understand web scraping (just a personal interest that I've been wanting to get intoðŸ¥º).

* [Pattern Matching](Python-Basics/2-Automating-Tasks/Regexes.py)
  - Notes on Regular Expressions (Regexes)
  - TODO: Practice project to apply understanding of regexes

Future projects/topics for this section:
- File I/O
- Web scraping
- Sending emails/texts
- Image manipulation
- GUI automation
