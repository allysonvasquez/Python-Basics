# Python Basics
The purpose of this repository is to brush up on my Python skills and implement old & new concepts learned to different types of scripts.
My end goal is to apply what I learn to AI/ML concepts, algorithms, and models.

## Programming Basics
My goal in this section is to simply refresh my memory on python syntax.

* [Calculator](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/Calculator.py)
  - Review over basic syntax, math operators, and data type casting for variables.
* [String Manipulator](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/StringManipulation.py)
  - Manipulation of strings; uses concatenation, substrings, slicing, and other string operators.
* [Comparison/Boolean Operators](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/Comparison.py)
  - Practice using random operator & boolean/comparison operators with user input
* [Functions](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/FunctionPractice.py)
  - Using lists and functions to solve prompts in [Python functions - Exercises, Practice, Solution](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-functions-exercises.php)
* [Dictionaries](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/Classes.py)
  - Notes on dictionaries that cover its syntax and methods
* [Classes](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/Classes.py)
  - Example of class syntax

## Automating Tasks
This section will cover topics that are unfamiliar to me. There will be a mix of in-depth notes and practice projects.
My goal in this section is to fully understand web scraping (just a personal interest that I've been wanting to get intoðŸ¥º).

* [Pattern Matching](Python-Basics/2-Automating-Tasks/Regexes.py) - Notes on Regular Expressions (Regexes)
  - TODO: Practice project to apply understanding of regexes
* [File I/O](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/2-Automating%20Tasks/FileIO.py) - Notes on File I/O Syntax
  - TODO: Practice project on FileIO & File organization
* [Web scraping](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/2-Automating%20Tasks/WebScraping.py) - Basic web scrape using a simple html [file](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/2-Automating%20Tasks/simple.html) and Corey Shafer's [tutorial](https://youtu.be/ng2o98k983k)
  - [Practice project](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/2-Automating%20Tasks/WebScraping2.py) - web scrape using data from [Corey Schafer's](https://coreyms.com) website
  - [Requests](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/2-Automating%20Tasks/Requests.py) - Notes on requests library for use in web scraping
* [Excel, Word, PDF](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Portfolio/blob/master/2-Automating%20Tasks/Excel_Word_PDF.py) - Notes on reading, writing, and editing data in these formats

Future topics for this section:
- Sending emails/texts
- Image manipulation
- GUI automation

## Side Projects
This section will consist of side projects I create to apply what I learned!
### Recipe Scrape
[RecipeScrape](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/tree/master/3-Side%20Projects/RecipeScraper) scrapes the [Breakfast Eggs Ready](https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/easy-egg-breakfast/) article from allrecipes.com. 

The current purpose of RecipeScrape is to collect the simplest-to-make egg recipes and format the data into an easy to read table. I will be personally cooking and eating the recipes mentioned... to ensure that they are worhty of being listed.
#### Problems
The biggest issue I had was figuring out the html attributes and tags in order to parse all of the data and links. My knowledge in html is basic, so this was a slight learning curve.
  - Reading through Dataquest's [tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/) helped immensely with being able to identify tags.
#### How to Improve This Project
I would like to reformat the third column of the recipe table so that it displays the actual recipe instead of a link to the recipe online. (currently working on this!)


## Other/Future Goals
More of a 'TODO' section:
- Learn how to use Git and Jupyter Notebook
- Refresh on Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics
- Create AI/ML Repository
