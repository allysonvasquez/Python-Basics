# Python Basics
I am using Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) and peer-reviewed academic journal [The Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/) as guides to review and create basic concepts in python.

## Programming Basics
These projects cover basic concepts. My goal in this section is to refresh my memory on python syntax.

* [Calculator](Python-Basics/1-Programming-Basics/Calculator.py)
  - Review over basic syntax, math operators, and data type casting for variables.
* [String Manipulator](Python-Basics/1-Programming-Basics/StringManipulation.py)
  - Manipulation of strings; uses concatenation, substrings, slicing, and other string operators.
* [Comparison/Boolean Operators](Python-Basics/1-Programming-Basics/Comparison.py)
  - Practice using random operator & boolean/comparison operators with user input

I plan to create projects that cover:
- Functions
- Dictionaries & lists
- Objects/OOP

## Automating Tasks
These projects will be about and task that can be automated. My goal in this section is to learn more about web scraping (just a personal interest that I've been wanting to get into ðŸ¥º).

In this section I plan to create projects that cover:
- Pattern matching
- File I/O
- Web scraping
- Sending emails/texts
- Image manipulation
- GUI automation
