# Python Basics
I am using Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) and peer-reviewed academic journal [The Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/) as guides to review and practice basic concepts in python.

Some topics use coding exercises from [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python/python-tutorial.php)

My end goal is to learn about AI/ML concepts, algorithms, and models.

## Programming Basics
My goal in this section is to simply refresh my memory on python syntax.

* [Calculator](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/Calculator.py)
  - Review over basic syntax, math operators, and data type casting for variables.
* [String Manipulator](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/StringManipulation.py)
  - Manipulation of strings; uses concatenation, substrings, slicing, and other string operators.
* [Comparison/Boolean Operators](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/Comparison.py)
  - Practice using random operator & boolean/comparison operators with user input
* [Functions](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/FunctionPractice.py)
  - Using lists and functions to solve prompts in [Python functions - Exercises, Practice, Solution](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-functions-exercises.php)
* [Dictionaries](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/Classes.py)
  - Notes on dictionaries that cover its syntax and methods
* [Classes](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/1-Programming%20Basics/Classes.py)
  - Example of class syntax

## Automating Tasks
This section will cover topics that are unfamiliar to me. There will be a mix of in-depth notes and practice projects.
My goal in this section is to fully understand web scraping (just a personal interest that I've been wanting to get intoðŸ¥º).

* [Pattern Matching](Python-Basics/2-Automating-Tasks/Regexes.py)
  - Notes on Regular Expressions (Regexes)
  - TODO: Practice project to apply understanding of regexes
* [File I/O](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/2-Automating%20Tasks/FileIO.py)
  - Notes on File I/O Syntax
  - TODO: Practice project on FileIO & File organization
* [Web scraping](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/2-Automating%20Tasks/WebScraping.py)
  - Basic web scrape using a simple html [file](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/2-Automating%20Tasks/simple.html) and Corey Shafer's [tutorial](https://youtu.be/ng2o98k983k)
  - [Practice project](https://github.com/allysonvasquez/Python-Basics/blob/master/2-Automating%20Tasks/WebScraping2.py): web scrape using data from [Corey Schafer's](https://coreyms.com) website

Future topics for this section:
- Sending emails/texts
- Image manipulation
- GUI automation

## Side Projects
This section will consist of small side projects I create to apply what I learned!

Future project topics:
- TBD

## Other/Future Goals
More of a 'TODO' section:
- Learn how to use Jupyter Notebook
- Refresh on Linear Algebra & Statistics
- Create AI/ML Basics Repository
