"Breakfast may be the most important meal of the day, but getting a nutritious, filling meal on the table can feel like a huge challenge when you're rushing to get ready for the day — particularly if your coffee hasn't kicked in yet. It's easy to just reach for a store-bought bar or frozen breakfast, but a satisfying home-cooked breakfast can be on the table in mere minutes with the help of one superstar ingredient: eggs. Easy breakfast eggs are tasty, versatile, and packed with protein to keep you feeling full. Here are 15 quick and easy breakfast egg recipes to try — each of them ready in 15 minutes or less."
"Whether you call this dish egg in a hole, egg in a frame, toad in a hole, or anything else, this fun twist on fried eggs and toast is sure to bring a smile to your face (and belly!). Though this recipe calls for cooking in bacon grease, many reviewers chime in to note that butter or olive oil work here, too. And, though recipe creator rosburn likes a runny egg, this speedy egg recipe can easily be customized. Reviewer Cookies says, ""I turn down the heat after I put the egg in and cover with a lid for a few minutes or until the white and most of the yolk is cooked. I sometimes scramble the egg before putting it in the hole (kids like it this way)."""
"""Eggs, avocado, and mustard are a great combination,"" says chefdad. "" says chefdad. ""Very good for weekdays or when you need a grab-and-go breakfast."""
"This recipe for Mexican breakfast tacos will have a restaurant-quality meal on your breakfast table in just about 15 minutes. With crumbled chorizo, scrambled eggs, Monterey jack cheese, salsa, and hot sauce, this flavor bomb will surely fuel your day. User Merlethecat likes to add sauteed onions and peppers to the eggs and top with tomato and green onion, and also notes, ""following the directions included in this recipe for warming the corn tortillas is important—just warming in the microwave or in foil in the oven does not do the trick!"" To slash even more time off this speedy recipe, cook the chorizo the night before. You can reheat it quickly in the morning and set it aside to add to the scramble."
"Healthy, flavorful, and filling? This egg white omelet with avocado and feta cheese checks all the boxes — plus it comes together in just 10 minutes! Recipe creator Kimberly Coventry says, ""This super-simple egg white omelet is loaded with protein and good fats to start your day off right!"" Reviewers note that you can add other veggies you have around, and can use whole eggs as well with great results."
"This outside-the-(egg) box recipe calls for grating Parmesan cheese into a skillet before adding whisked eggs so that the cheese forms a crispy exterior layer for an omelet. ""The caramelized cheese formed a thin but protective layer and, since the eggs had never directly touched the pan, they were moist and tender,"" explains recipe creator Chef John. ""This will also work whether you use one or three eggs, depending on the texture you're going for. Using a single egg is kind of a cool trick, since the cheese layer is almost as thick, and you can really appreciate the crispness even more."" Reviewers love this recipe and suggest adding cooked meat and/or veggies into the middle before folding in half."
"""Excellent recipe. I was skeptical about the nutmeg but it was perfect,"" says Heaven. ""I used Parmesan and provolone cheese, and it was delicious. My whole family gobbled it up."""
"As recipe creator Matt D says, this is ""a quick breakfast if you're trying to avoid carbs."" Containing just scrambled eggs, canned beans, sliced avocado, and salsa, there's very little prep required, yet this breakfast dish yields a whole lotta flavor — plus plenty of protein and good fats to keep your energy levels high. MCabrera75 says, ""I seasoned the beans with green onion, cilantro, garlic, onion powder, and pepper and cooked them on the stove top. My daughter and I love black beans and really liked this for breakfast. It was filling and left us satisfied well into our busy day!"" Some folks like to add shredded cheese and sour cream as well."
"""This is an absolutely great twist on conventional scrambled eggs,"" says dennis.chu. ""Vibrant filling and popping with flavor. Like many other reviewers have mentioned cutting back from 1 tbsp. of dried basil to 1 tsp. helps to not overpower the dish with the basil flavor. I also added the feta cheese in later when the egg was on the pan cooking as to not have it lost amidst the egg when it was cooking."" "
"Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best. Nothing is easier than hard-boiled eggs—in theory, anyway. But it can be tricky to get them just right! Follow Chef John's fool-proof method (watch the video for some extra tips) to learn how to make hard-boiled eggs with soft, creamy yolks every time. Nancy Kashou Ormsby raves, ""I was skeptical because I've tried two suggestions before and it never comes out the way I want. I tried this and PERFECTION. Thank you, thank you!!"" These make a great grab-and-go breakfast on their own, can be packed for a midday snack or added to salads, and can be made ahead of time for a fuss-free morning."
"Do you really need a recipe for scrambled eggs? Allrecipes home cooks suggest that maybe you do — and that you should give this one a try. Recipe creator mimo1099 has tweaked this version to perfection—and reviewers agree! ""To-die-for scrambled eggs! Only one change next time: Double the recipe! The secret? Cheddar cheese, a teaspoon of heavy cream, and ham (if you like) bring this quick breakfast staple to the next level."
"You read that right: this is a recipe for a pancake breakfast sandwich. Does it get any better than that? (We think not.) Also, since this utilizes leftover pancakes, all you have to do is fry an egg and warm up the ham and pancakes. Jillian says, ""Simple and delicious! What a great idea for a quick and easy breakfast treat! I love the combination of sweet and salty. Whenever I make homemade pancakes, I make a ton—enough to freeze a few for a future date. This was a perfect reason to thaw a few and assemble these sandwiches."""
"Egg in a hole may be classic, but for anyone who's gone paleo or is trying to watch their carbs or gluten, this variation using bell pepper slices instead of bread is the way to go. Plus the presentation in a pepper ring is quite fabulous! A number of reviewers suggest cooking the pepper slightly first. Peggy Finn says, ""Super easy and fast! I made it just as written except I browned the pepper rings a few mins to soften them. It was delicious. The peppers were still a bit crunchy."""
"Feeling a little fancy but short on time? Whip up this ancient recipe for cloud eggs, which tastes just as dreamy as it sounds and is ready in just 15 minutes. Recipe creator Olenka explains, ""this centuries-old recipe for cloud eggs was developed in France, and called Eggs in Snow, or Oeufs a la Neige. It's a show-stopping brunch dish that is actually ridiculously easy to make."" Reviewer Jaclyn notes that it can be easily customized by folding crumbled bacon, tomatoes, shredded cheese, or other ingredients into the egg whites before cooking."
"""Eggs goat cheese and Sriracha, yum! I added the Sriracha with the egg mixture. The flavor is unbeatable, and the texture is smooth and creamy,"" says Buckwheat Queen. ""It serves well with a bloody mary."""
"Though it's simple, the Fried Egg Sandwich will never let you down. ""You can use any type of bread or cheese that you want for this quick and easy breakfast,"" recipe submitter Erica says."
